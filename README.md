## Project Synopsis
Our project aims to create a space where undergraduates can compare four-year
plans and share courses they are currently and are planning on taking. We want
to be the social middle ground between
[ExploreCourses](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu) and
[Carta](https://carta-beta.stanford.edu), allowing users to clearly visualize
what their and their peers' schedules will look like. 

In our mobile app, users are able to input their four-year plan, view their
progress on requirements such as units and [Ways](https://ways.stanford.edu),
and check out what their peers are taking. Users' profiles will consist of their
academic year, major, clubs and interests and more! Based on oneâ€™s courses,
interests, and friends, we will offer them recommendations for courses to take
in the future.

### Technologies
Frontend - Expo App (TypeScript)

To run the app, run these commands:

```sh
cd app
expo start
```

Then, type `Shift + i` to select an iOS simulator to run the app on.

Backend - Firebase

To publish the app to the App Store, use the following commands:

```sh
eas build -p ios
eas submit -p ios --latest
```
