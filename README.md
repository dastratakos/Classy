## Project Synopsis
  Our project aims to create a space where undergraduates can compare four year plans and share courses they are currently and are planning on taking. We want to be the social middle ground between explore courses and carta, allowing users to clearly visualize what their and their peers' schedules will look like. 

  In our webapp, users are able to input their four year plan, view their progress on requirements such as units and ways, and check out what their peers are taking. User’s profiles will consist of their academic year, major, sport (if applicable), hobbies, clubs and more! Based on one’s courses, interests, and following, we will offer them recommendations for courses to take in the future.
